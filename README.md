# Miltonëor
ASCII-based RPG game written in python (as a university work)

Miltonëor is a fantasy text RPG set in the shadow-haunted land of Ynev, where ancient gods, dragons, and legendary heroes shape the fate of the world. Inspired by classic role-playing adventures, Miltonëor combines procedural map generation, turn-based battles, and a living world filled with danger and discovery.

You begin your journey in the battered border town of Arascor, where fear and legend mingle in the wake of a colossal dragon’s wrath. As a lone adventurer, you’ll explore a dynamically generated map of towns, wildlands, shops, and secret places—each playthrough offering a new landscape and fresh challenges. Gather resources, battle monsters from goblins to dragons, and seek out allies like the enigmatic Arcenseran of Yllanor.

Miltonëor features:
- Procedurally generated maps for endless replayability
- Classic RPG mechanics: health, attack, potions, gold, and inventory management
- Turn-based combat with a variety of enemies and loot
- Shops, towns, and special locations with unique interactions
- Colorful terminal interface and ASCII art banners
- Save/load system to continue your quest at any time

Will you unravel the secrets of the ancient gods and save Ynev from ruin, or fall to the darkness that stalks the land?
Forge your legend in Miltonëor!
